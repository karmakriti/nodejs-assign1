# Lab Assignment #1

## Objective

1. Create a new text file that contains a paragraph of any contents (6 to 8 lines).
2. Create a JavaScript file to use the Node.JS built-in function to read text file contents. Use the function that supports non-blocking operation (not the blocking one).
3. Output the content (the paragraph) to the terminal.

## Instructions

1. A new text file `newfile.txt` is created with a sample paragraph.
2. The JavaScript file `asynchronous.js` uses Node.js's `fs` module to write and read the text file asynchronously.
3. The content of the text file is output to the terminal.
